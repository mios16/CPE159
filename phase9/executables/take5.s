# take5.s
# below is only a demo code, it calls Sleep(5) and Exit(99)
# change it to:
#    sleep for the period of seconds that is its PID, and
#    exit with its PID multiplied by two.
#
# Enter "makeit.pl take5.s" and it will automagically does:
#    as --32 take5.s -o take5.o 
#    link386 -nostartfiles -userapp take5.o -o take5
#    extract/convert executable take5 into text take5.bin
#
# The final generated file "take5.bin" is the purpose here, and
# it is to be included into file services (see Procedure.txt).
#
# If curious to see the memory map, enter: as -a take5.s
