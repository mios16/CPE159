   (shouldn't happen, a Panic message can be considered)

   in PCB, upcount both runtime and total_runtime of running process

   if the runtime has reached TIME_LIMIT:
      reset its runtime
      change its state to READY
      queue it to ready queue
      set running PID to -1
      (Scheduler() will get next PID from ready queue if any;
      if none, Scheduler will pick 0 as running PID)
